            <h1>About Our Mission</h1>
            <p>We believe that everyone, regardless of physical ability, should have access to the rich world of audio content. From captivating stories in audiobooks to insightful podcast discussions, digital audio has the power to educate, entertain, and connect us.</p>
            <p>Blue Wave Player was born from this belief. It is a project dedicated to creating a simple, powerful, and completely free audio player that is fully accessible to visually impaired users. We are committed to working with the community to build a tool that is not just functional, but a joy to use.</p>
            <p>This project is open-source, and we welcome feedback and contributions from everyone.</p>
